	<h1 class="page-title">Best Practices for Secure Zoom Meetings</h1>

	<div class="dateline">March 5, 2021</div>

	<p>Zoom has been a critical tool in our daily lives this past year; from virtual classes and student activities to checking in with family and friends, we rely on Zoom to keep us connected. Naturally, no one wants those moments of connection disrupted by unwanted visitors or inappropriate behavior. Unfortunately, spring term has already seen an increase in the number of Zoom bombings reported.</p>

	<p>At Ohio State, our default CarmenZoom settings were designed to help protect our students, faculty and staff, and our recommended guidelines go even further to help you prevent and respond to Zoom bombing attacks. We outline a variety of measures you can take to keep your meetings safe, but these two steps can make a huge difference:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<strong>Require authentication</strong>
			for meetings with Ohio State attendees. We recently made logging in even easier, so authentication does not need to be a hassle.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Protect your meeting links.</strong>
			It is strongly recommended that you do NOT share meeting URLs publicly on websites or social media.</li>
	</ol>


	<p>Review more options you can take before, during and after a CarmenZoom meeting to protect you and your attendees:</p>

	<h2>Before the meeting…</h2>

	<p>How you plan to promote to your intended audience will guide your meeting setting choices. Before setting up the meeting, consider who you want to attend and how you will share meeting information with them.</p>

	<h3>Sharing</h3>

	<p>It is strongly recommended that you don’t share meeting information publicly on websites or social media. If you want your event available to a wide audience, consider using Zoom’s registration options to better track who will be joining. With a smaller group of attendees who have registered and provided contact information, it may be feasible to send a passcode separately just to those you anticipate in the meeting. If you want only the host and designated panelists to be able to share during the event,
		<a href="https://teaching.resources.osu.edu/toolsets/carmenzoom/guides/meetings-v-webinars-comparison" class="ext" target="_blank">consider requesting a webinar</a>
		instead of using a standard meeting.</p>

	<h3>Passcodes</h3>

	<p>When creating new meetings in CarmenZoom, passcodes are added automatically within the meeting link. This embedded passcode makes it harder for hackers to guess your URL or stumble across your meeting, while also allowing your attendees to join your meeting with just one click. For additional security, you can choose to turn off the embedded passcode send a passcode separately to your intended meeting participants. This method would require hackers to have two pieces of information—the URL and a separate passcode.</p>

	<p>After planning how to share your meeting and how to get meeting details to intended participants, consider the following settings when creating your meeting in CarmenZoom.</p>

	<h3>Registration and Waiting Room</h3>

	<p>If you have people joining from outside the university, you won't be able to use the authentication option, but you can make good use of two other features.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Registration:</strong>
			Use
			<a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/211579443-Registration-for-Meetings" class="ext" target="_blank">Zoom's registration option</a>
			for your meeting or webinar. You can customize the fields for your attendees to complete; Zoom will send them an individualized meeting link and passcode. Adding custom fields that relate to your event and using the option to manually approve registrations will give you an opportunity to screen potential attendees and block those who don’t have a legitimate interest in your event.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Waiting Room:</strong>
			The
			<a href="https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/02/14/secure-your-meetings-zoom-waiting-rooms/?zcid=1231" class="ext" target="_blank">Waiting Room</a>
			is a virtual staging area that stops your guests from joining until you're ready for them. This way you can screen participants and only allow those you are expecting to join. Take a good look at the display name for each entrant before letting them in to the meeting.&nbsp; Many of the people who have disrupted Zoom meetings at Ohio State and elsewhere have advertised their bad intentions by using obviously offensive display names or names that are gross puns when said out loud.</li>
	</ul>
